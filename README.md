Jquery-mobile website, to act as global remote for my home theater
===================================================================

Using a commandir box, I'm able to send ir_code from scripts, which allow me to combine and automate differents remote ! Kind of like the harmony but homemade ;)

Last update:
------------
Simple changes, basic version is working but lot's of todo !

To do:
------
- implement xbmc listing of movie and tvshows, using json-rpc
- implement gesture
- change buttons and create something more usefull (so far it's just a test)

Explanations of the folders:
----------------------------

**ir_codes** - several ir_code i recorded using commandir, specific to a samsung TV, a yamaha RXv465 and a Freebox v5

**scripts** - cgi-bin used for launching ir_codes from web pages

**web** - web pages, using jquery mobile
